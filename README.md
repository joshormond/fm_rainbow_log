# fm_log_tail

colorized tail for Import.log

TODO: the code is getting confused and cutting off some lines and starting others too early. Try running it on Import.log and compare to opening Import.log directly to see what i mean. The date `2023-04-27 20:42:31.830` appears fewer times in the output of my code than in the original file.
NOTE: the cat cli utility also seems to fail unless I save the output to a file like cat Import.log > DuplicateImport.log.
